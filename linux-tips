To mount an NTFS disk on Linux:
sudo fdisk -l	// to see where is your device (usually /dev/sdb1)
sudo mkdir /media/external	// path where your disk root will be mapped to
sudo mount -t mtfs-3g /dev/sdb1 /media/external

To open the default file manager from the command line:
xdg-open .
To open files from the terminal as if you'd double clicked them in the file manager:
xdg-open file

Starting with kernel 5.18, need to add kernel option ibt=off to /etc/default/grub and update grub in order to use the non free nvidia drivers (T1200).
